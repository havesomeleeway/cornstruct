I’ve returned from Nepal having completed the Annapurna Base Camp trek with my wife, the supposed less touristy version compared to Everest Base Camp which has a serious trash problem

What was both startling and humbling was the fact that Nepal is the poorest country in South Asia and the 17th poorest in the world. Approximately 25 percent of Nepalis live below the poverty line, the result of centuries of political unrest as well as natural disasters. Over the course of the trek, I also learned that my porters were paid really poorly, that they do it not because they enjoy it, but simply because there are no better alternatives. As a result, I could not help but wonder if my desire to see the world was also part of the problem, contributing to what feels like exploitation of these people.

 Also, here are some points summarising Nepal’s history.

- Nepal was unified in the 18th century under Prithvi Narayan Shah, but the country’s development was hindered by a period of hereditary prime ministers known as the Rana regime from 1846 to 1951.
- The country transitioned to a constitutional monarchy in 1951, but political instability persisted with frequent changes in government and power struggles between the monarchy and political parties.
- A decade-long Maoist insurgency from 1996 to 2006 resulted in over 12,000 deaths and further destabilised the country.
- The royal massacre in 2001, where the crown prince killed most of the royal family, shocked the nation and added to the political turmoil.
- In 2008, the 239-year-old monarchy was abolished, and Nepal became a federal democratic republic.
- Despite the transition to democracy, Nepal has continued to face political instability, with 14 different governments since 2008.
- Economic challenges persist, including a heavy reliance on remittances, limited industrial development, and vulnerability to natural disasters.
- Nepal’s geopolitical position between India and China has added complexity to its development, as it navigates relationships with both powerful neighbours.
