For the last year or so, I've been maintaining a site over at super.so. It does a good enough job at most of what I expect of it but I just could not justify paying the monthly fee of $16 per month. In addition, it was also missing certain publishing control features at that price point which meant that even my drafts were being automatically published. For the uniniated, super.so basically uses your notion page a content management system, pulls data over and applies a cosmetic UI layer over that content.

I'm still in the midst of cleaning up this boilerplate which is a rehash of https://eleventy-excellent.netlify.app/ and I'm really excited to see where I can take this.
