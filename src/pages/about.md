**{{ "2015-04-01" | workExperience }}** - this timespan is the exact duration as of this very moment that I've spent working as a designer in the technology space. The exact job title varies depending on the companies I am at, but across this timespan I have tried and failed to build two startups, designed a bunch of corporate applications for both internal staff and consumer usage, and also briefly tried my hand at freelancing.

My story is not too dissimilar those growing up in the nineties, involving a copious amount of dial-up internet, Blogspot, Neopets, Gameboy, and internet forums. Those were also the days where I discovered the magic of HTML and CSS by personalising my forum, and also when I first understood the implications of cybersecurity through SQL injections, where I could create rare items within games to my own specifications.

While this interest and wonder never ended up translating into a formal design or computer specific domain of education, I eventually found my way back into the industry and that's where I have been ever since. Today, the web and its ecosystems are vastly different from the time when I would rush home for a game of [Planet Hot Wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Hot_Wheels) with my friend. It's gated, corporatised, and relies excessively on subscription-as-a-service models or your attention span as currencies. 

This minuscule corner on the internet where my site sits represents my rough manifestation of thoughts that I have decided to display online. There are no algorithms to control likes or suggested posts here, and all I hope for this bastion of resistance is a sense of what the web was like back in the days, open and fun.

### Lately
I've been working as a Senior Designer at [EPAM](https://www.epam.com/) for roughly {{ "2023" | workExperience }}, where I collaboratively design and develop solutions for our corporate clients such as DHL, Heineken, HSBC, and more. In my free time, I do my best to volunteer with non-profit organisations such as [The Astronauts Collective](https://www.hellotac.org/) engaging youths and students to help them bridge that school-to-life transition.


### Fun facts in no specific order of fun-ness
1. I love baking. Cookbooks have had a special draw on me prior to any genre of books as far as I can remember. One of my core memories involves sprinting to a neighbourhood cake shop, begging for them to sell me a carton of whipped cream as I was desperately trying to rescue a failed chocolate ganache at home.
2. I have an extreme love-hate relationship with running. To non-runners, I run way too much and to serious runners, I run way too little.
3. I really like jazz piano, but I'm not really good with it.
4. I think the world would be a happier place if more people approached it with a child-like wonder of limitless curiosity.
