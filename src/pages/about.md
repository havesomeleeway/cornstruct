This very image that you see here happens to be the exact image I use at work when introducing myself, as well as during my volunteering engagements with students and youths. It’s abstracted just enough to show the details that I want to highlight, and messy enough to invoke questions.

![The original source of inspiration for the image above](/assets/images/gallery/about_me_figma.png 'I wouldn’t say it’s entirely original, as it was heavily inspired by how Figma’s Chief Product Officer, Yukhi Yamashita referenced modern-day product design in a blog post titled “Welcome to the WIP”')

What struck me most in the original post were the parallels I could draw between design or any form of collaborative work and life, chiefly the fact that neither follows an entirely linear path. This observation perfectly describes my journey thus far. It has been messy, undulating, and even at times bloody due to cuts suffered during an embarrasingly brief stint working in the kitchen.

Through an enormous amount of soul-searching over the years, I’ve uncovered two constants:
1. An insatiable curiosity to figure things out
2. An innate desire to ‘make it better’ once I’ve figured it out

</div>

These two traits are likely why I dare say I love my profession so much, and why I try to spread that gospel as much as possible. In my free time, I do my best to volunteer with charity organisations, engaging youths and students to help them bridge that school-to-life transition.
