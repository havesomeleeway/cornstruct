{{ "2015-04-01" | workExperience }}. As of this very moment that you're reading this, it is the duration which I've spent working as a designer in the technology space. The exact job title varies depending on the companies I am at, but across this timespan I have tried and failed to build two startups, designed a bunch of corporate applications for both internal staff and consumer usage, and also briefly tried my hand at freelancing.

My story not to dissimilar to those born in the eighties to nineties, involving a copious amount of dial-up internet, Blogspot, Neopets, and internet forums. Those were also the days where I discovered the magic of HTML and CSS by personalising my forum, and also when I first understood the implications of cybersecurity through SQL injections, where I could create rare items within games to my own specifications.

While this interest and wonder never ended up translating into a formal design or computer specific domain of education, I eventually found my way back into the industry and that's where I have been ever since. This minuscule speck on the internet where my site sits is my attempt at reclaiming how I felt about the web back in the 2000s, a time when it was interesting to checkout new sites. I also hestiate to call this a portfolio, as it represents a rough manifestation of thoughts that I've decided to display online, away from corporate social media feeds.

I aim to update this site as constantly as I'm able to, for I see it as a garden as opposed to a finished piece of work.
